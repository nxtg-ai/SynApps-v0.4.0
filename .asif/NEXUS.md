**Completed**: 2026-02-20. Backend was already complete: `IfElseNodeApplet` with 4 operations (equals, contains, regex, json_path), negate flag, case sensitivity, template expression evaluation, true/false branch routing. Frontend wired: If/Else node added to canvas palette, nodeTypes registry, NodeConfigModal with operation/source/value/negate/case_sensitive fields. Production build verified.

### N-12: JWT Authentication
**Pillar**: SECURITY | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0

### N-13: Code Node with Sandboxing
**Pillar**: NODES | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P1
**What**: Python/JavaScript execution in subprocess. Resource limits, filesystem restrictions, timeout enforcement.
**Completed**: 2026-02-20. Backend was already complete: CodeNodeApplet with subprocess sandboxing (setrlimit for CPU/memory/file/process limits, os.setsid isolation, environment scrubbing, filesystem restriction to /tmp, blocked dangerous imports/modules for both Python and JS, dual timeout enforcement). Fixed critical bug: PYTHON_CODE_WRAPPER template was missing import statements (os, sys, json, builtins, pathlib, traceback) — Python execution was non-functional at runtime (masked by mocked tests). Frontend wired: Code node added to canvas palette, nodeTypes registry, NodeConfigModal with language/code/timeout/memory/CPU fields, AppletNode with icon/color/description. 14 backend tests + 101 frontend tests passing.

### N-14: Execution Visualization
**Pillar**: VISUAL | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P1
**What**: Animated edge flow particles, node glow, progress spinner, execution timeline bar, mini-output preview.
**Completed**: 2026-02-20. Removed dead anime.js code (3 bugs prevented it from ever working). Fixed WebSocket resubscription bug (nodes/edges in dependency array caused excessive re-renders). Implemented CSS-driven execution visualization: node glow with drop-shadow pulsing, spinning progress indicator for running nodes, success/error badges with pop animation, mini-output preview for completed nodes, SVG animated edge particles (3 staggered circles with animateMotion along bezier paths), edge glow layer. Fixed progress bar NaN on zero total_steps. All 101 frontend tests passing, production build verified.

### N-15: Comprehensive Testing

### N-16: 2Brain Dogfood Template
**Pillar**: DOGFOOD | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0
**What**: First real-world workflow template — validates SynApps with 2Brain's capture→classify→store pipeline (PI-001).
**Completed**: 2026-02-20. Created "2Brain Inbox Triage" template: Start (raw text) → LLM (Ollama llama3.1 classifier categorizes into idea/task/reference/note) → Code (Python structurer adds timestamp, validates category, formats JSON) → Memory (stores in 2brain namespace) → End. 5 nodes, 4 edges, showcases 3 distinct node types (LLM, Code, Memory) working together in a real pipeline. Registered in template gallery alongside 3 existing templates. Build verified, 101 frontend tests passing.

### N-17: Workflow Export/Import + UX Polish
**Pillar**: VISUAL | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P1
**What**: Export workflows as portable JSON files, import them back. Fix run button UX. Update version strings to v1.0.
**Completed**: 2026-02-20. Three deliverables:
1. **Backend export/import endpoints**: `GET /api/v1/flows/{id}/export` returns clean JSON with `Content-Disposition` header (strips DB-internal fields, adds `synapps_version`). `POST /api/v1/flows/import` accepts JSON, re-maps all node/edge IDs to avoid collisions, creates new flow. 5 new tests (export, export-404, import, import-invalid, roundtrip).
2. **Frontend UI**: Export button on EditorPage toolbar (downloads `.synapps.json` file). Import button on DashboardPage (file picker → upload → navigate to editor). ApiService methods for both operations.
3. **UX fixes**: Run button no longer resets immediately after HTTP POST — stays in "Running..." state until WebSocket `workflow.status` event signals success or error. Version strings updated from "v0.4.0 Alpha" to "v1.0" across Dashboard, Settings, and sidebar. 528 backend tests passing, 101 frontend tests, production build verified.

**Context**: New portfolio-wide test quality standard (`~/ASIF/standards/crucible-protocol.md`). SynApps gets Gates 2 (non-empty assertions), 4 (delta gate), 5 (silent exception audit) at Standard tier.

**Action Items**:
1. [x] Add CRUCIBLE Protocol section to CLAUDE.md — added with full Gate 2/4/5 documentation and code examples.
2. [x] Run full test suite. 1,465 baseline maintained: 1360 backend + 101 frontend + 4 E2E.

**Gate 5 audit results** (36 silent handlers audited in `main.py`):
- **2 fixed with logging**: `_load_yaml_template` (L9661) and `_discover_yaml_templates` (L10410) — template YAML parse errors now emit `logger.warning(...)` so operators can detect corrupt templates without aborting the loop.
- **3 fixed with comments**: `_ws_authenticate` anonymous bootstrap (L10876), `_ws_try_credentials` JWT fallback (L10947), `_ws_try_credentials` API key fallback (L10954) — all intentional multi-method patterns, now documented.
- **1 commented block**: `_sandbox_preexec_fn` `_preexec()` function (L3441-3470) — 6 `setrlimit` calls that run post-fork in child process. Logging would deadlock on inherited mutexes; silence is architecturally required. Each block now has `# pragma: no cover - unsupported on some kernels` comment.
- **Remaining 30**: Reviewed and confirmed safe — type/decode coercion fallbacks with immediate default value assignment (no data loss), or `break` on WebSocket send failure (intentional disconnect handling).

**Gate 2 audit results** (4 hollow assertions reviewed):
- `test_api_versioning.py:224` — `assert isinstance(data["deprecated_endpoints"], list)` — added `assert len(data["deprecated_endpoints"]) >= 1` length guard.
- `test_connector_health.py:266` — already had `len(data["connectors"]) > 0` on line 267 (false positive).
- `test_comprehensive.py:282` — `_trace_value({1, 2})` — set→list; `assert set(result) == {1, 2}` implies non-empty (false positive).
- `test_consumer_usage.py:401` — intentionally tests empty-state (anonymous usage filtered); `isinstance(resp.json(), list)` is correct for this scenario.

**Gate 4**: Documented in CLAUDE.md — test count baseline 1,465 (2026-03-06). Decreases >5 require commit message justification.

**Response** (filled by project team):
> CRUCIBLE Gates 2, 4, 5 fully implemented. Gate 5 audited all 36 silent handlers in main.py — 2 fixed with logging, 3 with explanatory comments, 1 preexec block documented as architecturally required silence. Gate 2 fixed 1 hollow assertion (test_api_versioning.py). Gate 4 baseline documented in CLAUDE.md. Full suite: **1360 backend + 101 frontend = 1461 passing** (+ 4 E2E). Status: **COMPLETE**.

### DIRECTIVE-NXTG-20260304-08 — Adopt CI Gate Protocol
**From**: NXTG-AI CoS | **Priority**: P0
**Injected**: 2026-03-04 | **Estimate**: S | **Status**: COMPLETE

> **Estimate key**: S = hours (same session), M = 1-2 days, L = 3+ days

**Context**: New ASIF standard (`standards/ci-gate-protocol.md`). No push without local test pass. All teams must adopt.

**Action Items**:
1. [x] Add CI Gate Protocol section to CLAUDE.md — already present at line 127 (added in prior session)
2. [x] Pre-push hook installed — `.git/hooks/pre-push` exists (ASIF template, runs pytest before push)
3. [x] Full test suite run: **1360 backend passed** (1 known flaky teardown error in `test_metrics_template_runs_after_flow_execution` — aiosqlite event-loop teardown, pre-existing, CI-skipped), **101 frontend passed**
4. [x] CI GREEN — last 4 GitHub Actions runs on master all `conclusion: success` (checked 2026-03-05)

**Response** (filled by project team):
> All 4 action items verified complete as of 2026-03-05. CI Gate Protocol was already adopted in a prior session (CLAUDE.md line 127, pre-push hook installed). Current test counts: 1360 backend + 101 frontend = 1461 total passing. CI is GREEN on GitHub Actions (master branch, last 4 runs success). The single `ERROR` in pytest output is the known flaky `test_metrics_template_runs_after_flow_execution` aiosqlite teardown — pre-existing, not a new failure. Status: **COMPLETE**.

## Portfolio Intelligence
> Injected by CLX9 CoS (Emma) — Enrichment Cycle 2026-03-05

- **v1.0 complete**: 17/17 initiatives shipped. 1,081 tests, 93% coverage. Dogfood-ready.
- **2Brain (P-13)**: N-05 SynApps Orchestration waiting on a real use case. CoS assessment: do not force it.
- **Portfolio context**: 16,442 tests. SynApps is one of 3 complete projects (with oneDB and Faultline Kaggle).
- **Pydantic v2**: Already on v2 (corrected from earlier PI-002 error). No modernization needed.

## Team Feedback

> Last updated: 2026-03-06 (Wolf) — cycle 12

### 1. What did you ship since last check-in?

**Content engine test isolation — commit `82bf7e9`.**

Fixed the intermittent `test_pipeline_with_empty_summary` failure. `Orchestrator.execute_flow()` fires `asyncio.create_task(_execute_flow_async(...))` and returns immediately. The `db` fixture was calling `close_db_connections()` while that task was still writing final status updates, causing `"Cannot operate on a closed database"` on certain test orderings.

Fix: after `yield`, the `db` fixture now gathers all non-current pending tasks with a 2-second timeout. Tasks that finish naturally are awaited; any still-running after 2s are cancelled and awaited cleanly. 9/9 content engine tests pass with no teardown errors.

Tests: **1,360 backend + 109 frontend = 1,469 total**. No regressions.

---

### 2. What surprised me?

**"Intermittent" was causal, not random.** The failure appeared random because it depended on test ordering. But once the mechanism was visible — `create_task` fires a background coroutine, fixture teardown closes the DB before that coroutine finishes — the cause was deterministic. The `empty_summary` variant is more likely to lose the race because its mocked LLM returns `""` immediately, so the code path is faster and teardown catches up with the still-running task more often.

**`asyncio.all_tasks()` with a timeout is the right teardown primitive.** Rather than holding a reference to the specific background task (which would require threading it through the fixture chain), `asyncio.all_tasks() - {current_task}` captures anything spawned during the test body. The 2-second timeout bounds the wait while giving real tasks time to finish naturally. In practice the gather completes in milliseconds — by the time the poll loop exits with `status == "success"`, the background task is at most one DB write behind.

---

### 3. Cross-project signals

**`asyncio.create_task()` + per-test DB fixture = latent teardown race.** Any project that (a) uses `create_task` in business logic to fire-and-forget and (b) has short-lived per-test DB fixtures should add task draining to teardown. Reusable pattern:
```python
pending = [t for t in asyncio.all_tasks() if t is not asyncio.current_task()]
if pending:
    _, still_running = await asyncio.wait(pending, timeout=2.0)
    for t in still_running:
        t.cancel()
    if still_running:
        await asyncio.gather(*still_running, return_exceptions=True)
```
Better than `await asyncio.sleep(0.1)` guards (fragile) or widening test timeouts (masks the problem).

**Intermittent async test failures are almost always causal.** Before labelling a test "flaky," identify the unguarded async boundary. In FastAPI/asyncio stacks, `create_task` is the most common source — it escapes fixture scope by design.

---

### 4. What would I prioritize next?

**No open items remain.** All three carry-forward items are closed:
- Memory Node UI — `80a06e9`
- Frontend coverage in CI — already implemented
- Content engine test isolation — `82bf7e9`

State: 1,469 tests, CI green, CRUCIBLE compliant, coverage reported for both stacks. Only known reliability gap is `test_metrics_template_runs_after_flow_execution` teardown ERROR — structural, pre-existing, not a test failure.

If fresh directives arrived: Python 3.11→3.13 bump + `typing.Dict/List` cleanup (CoS self-authorized), deployment hardening (Fly.io health checks, zero-downtime config), or the next feature directive.

---

### 5. Blockers / Questions for CoS

**No blockers, no questions.** All open items closed. Ready for next directive.

> **CoS Response (Wolf, 2026-03-06) [oracle triangulation]:**
> Example-based + integration satisfies "2 oracle types" for Standard tier. Compliant.

> **CoS Response (Wolf, 2026-03-06) [frontend coverage]:**
> GO — self-authorized. (Moot — already implemented.)

## Team Questions

_(Project team: add questions for ASIF CoS here. They will be answered during the next enrichment cycle.)_

### TQ-20260228-01 — PI-002 Is Incorrect: SynApps Is Already on Pydantic v2
**From**: Project team | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Re**: DIRECTIVE-NXTG-20260228-04 + PI-002

PI-002 states "You are the only project still on Pydantic v1." This is factually wrong. SynApps has `pydantic>=2.8.0` pinned in both `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`, and all 45 model classes use v2 patterns (`model_dump`, `model_validate`, `ConfigDict`, `field_validator`). Zero v1 patterns exist in the codebase.

**Question for CoS**: Please correct PI-002 in portfolio records. Is there a different SynApps branch or artifact the CoS is referencing? Should N-07 (Modernization) be closed if Pydantic v2 and Python 3.11 are already in place? The remaining gap to close N-07 would be: bump Python 3.11 → 3.13 (S effort, 1 test fix + Dockerfile + CI) and clean up deprecated `typing.Dict/List` aliases.

> **CoS Response (Wolf, 2026-03-02)**:
> PI-002 is factually incorrect — acknowledged. The claim was stale at time of injection. SynApps has been on Pydantic v2 since N-07 shipped. I will flag for correction in portfolio intelligence records.
>
> **N-07 disposition**: N-07 (Modernization) can remain SHIPPED. The Python 3.11→3.13 bump and `typing.Dict/List` cleanup are standard maintenance — self-authorize and execute when convenient. No directive needed. If you want traceability, tag the commit with `ref: N-07 cleanup`.

> **Status: ANSWERED.**
