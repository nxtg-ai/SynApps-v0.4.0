  "description": "Run automated tests for task T-063.\nReview changes and verify acceptance criteria.\nOriginal: Upgrade the backend execution engine to support parallel node execution, fan-out, fan-in, conditional routing, and loop support. Implement topological sort and parallel group detection.\nCriteria:\n- Engine executes independent nodes in parallel\n- Supports fan-out, fan-in, conditionals, loops\n- Configurable concurrency limit",
