## Description

Run automated tests for task T-063.
Review changes and verify acceptance criteria.
Original: Upgrade the backend execution engine to support parallel node execution, fan-out, fan-in, conditional routing, and loop support. Implement topological sort and parallel group detection.
Criteria:
- Engine executes independent nodes in parallel
- Supports fan-out, fan-in, conditionals, loops
- Configurable concurrency limit

## Dependencies

- T-063

## Locked Files

- `apps/orchestrator/main.py`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Engine executes independent nodes in parallel
- [ ] Supports fan-out, fan-in, conditionals, loops
- [ ] Configurable concurrency limit
