## Assigned Tasks

### T-008: Design Backend Stack Upgrade Plan

Plan the migration of the backend codebase from Python 3.9/FastAPI 0.68/Pydantic v1/SQLAlchemy 1.4 to Python 3.11+, FastAPI 0.115+, Pydantic v2, and SQLAlchemy 2.0. Identify breaking changes, deprecated patterns, and required code updates. Specify steps for Alembic upgrade and database compatibility testing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Documented migration plan covering all major dependencies
- [ ] List of files and modules impacted by each upgrade
- [ ] Checklist of deprecated patterns to remove
- [ ] Strategy for Alembic auto-migration and database testing

### T-019: Redesign Workflow Editor UI

Overhaul the workflow editor layout: collapsible node palette (left), ReactFlow canvas (center), node inspector (right), execution log (bottom), top bar (name/run/save).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Editor layout matches spec
- [ ] All panels functional and responsive
- [ ] No major regressions

**Files you may modify:**
- `apps/web-frontend/src/`

### T-023: Design Execution Engine Parallelism and Routing

Design the upgraded execution engine supporting parallel execution, fan-in/fan-out, conditional routing, loop support, error handling, and execution history. Specify data structures, algorithms, and API changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detailed design document for execution engine
- [ ] Clear algorithms for topological sort and parallel group detection
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic specified
- [ ] API changes documented

### T-034: Harden REST API and WebSocket Protocol

Ensure REST API uses consistent error format, pagination, strict request validation, and versioning. Update WebSocket protocol for structured messages, reconnection, and authentication.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] REST API returns consistent error objects
- [ ] All list endpoints paginated
- [ ] Strict validation via Pydantic v2
- [ ] API versioning in place
- [ ] WebSocket messages structured and authenticated

**Files you may modify:**
- `apps/orchestrator/main.py`

## Governance

- Report task completion via MCP: `forge_complete_task()`
- Do NOT modify files outside your locked file list
- Run tests before marking task complete
- Check `.forge/state.json` for current orchestration state
